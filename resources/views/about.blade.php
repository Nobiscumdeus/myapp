<p> I was introduced to programming in my sophomoric year in the University and I startd out with python 
    which was part of my course requirements as of then.
</p>
<p>
    One way or the other , I got fascinated about the field of programming and determined to pursue it to its ultimate
    end to create innovative discoveries as well as solutions for human problems
